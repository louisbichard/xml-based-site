        The section is open to all serving and retired South Yorkshire Police officers, Staff, and their guests. The aim of the section is to provide an opportunity for members to take part in the sport of Yacht Cruising, frequently thought of as an elite sport, in safe and affordable way. Each year we aim to offer at least three trips, at less than half the cost of a commercial trip.

        Every year we organise multi boat trips with up to 5 yachts giving up to 32 members the opportunity to cruise the Solent and beyond.

        Trips normally cost around £200 - £250, including charter fee, food, fuel, mooring fees etc. In the past 3 years we have taken over 125 members on cruises from the Solent, Suffolk and Essex, Scotland and the Devon and Cornwall coast across to the Channel Isles. The section has even organised a 3 week trip through Greece in 2012!
