        <introduction>
            <paragraph>
                The section is committed to developing skills of its members. Although there are no formal qualifications issued to those who take part in the trips, members will gain valuable experience, and build miles on each trip at a fraction of the cost of a commercial sailing holiday.
            </paragraph>
            <paragraph>
                A skippers training week runs every year in March or April. This is for qualified skippers, approved by the Section Committee, who will be skippering on one of the organised trips. The aim of the week will be to improve confidence and skills in the skippers and ensure a corporate approach to safety.
            </paragraph>
            <paragraph>
                The aim is to ensure that all members participating in organised trips have as safe and enjoyable trip as possible.

                The Section is keen to create links with other organisations (see useful Links page). Members are encouraged to attend RYA theory and practical courses to improve their safety and confidence. We will look to negotiate discounts and consider a subsidy in certain circumstances.

                    This is a 1 day course which is an excellent insight into safety equipment and procedures. The course, which includes a 2 hour session in a swimming pool, gives students an opportunity to experience swimming with their full waterproofs on, wearing a lifejacket.
                </paragraph>
                <paragraph>
                    Students will also become familiar with boarding a liferaft and righting one which has capsized.

                <paragraph>
                    6 members including 4 skippers have already successfully qualified. Future courses are planned to take part in Doncaster. Please contact the section for more details.
